🎤  Lyrics:
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much

Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time
Taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my

I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
Help me</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
She's like the wind,
Through my tree
She rides the night
Next to me

She leads me through moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
She's taken my heart
But she doesn't know what she's done

Feel her breath in my face
Her body close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league

Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind

I look in the mirror
And all I see
Is a young old man
With only a dream
Am I just fooling myself
That she'll stop the pain?
Living without her
I'd go insane!

I feel her breath in my face
Her body close to me
Can't look in her eyes
She's out of my league

Just a fool to believe
I have anything she needs
She's like the wind

I feel your breath in my face
Your body close to me
Can't look in your eyes
You're out of my league

Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe)
She's like the wind

(Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe
(She's like the wind)

Just a fool to believe (Just a fool to believe)
She's like the wind

(Just a fool to believe) Just a fool to believe
She's like the wind

(Just a fool...she's like the wind)

(She's like the wind)

(Just a fool...she's like the wind)
(Just a fool...)</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all

And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you

I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you

And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would have followed you
Oh, oh, oh, oh say something, I'm giving up on you

Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longin' for change
And in the bad times I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for change
And in the bad times I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We're far from the shallow now
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoah!
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We're far from the shallow now</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Verse 2]
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops, I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I...

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

[Bridge]
Real good
We dance in the studio
Snap snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

[Chorus]
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay</td>

🎤  Lyrics:

I've been here all night, Ariana
I've been here all day, Nicki Minaj
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
Let them hoes know

I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin')
I'm comin' at ya
'Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, 'cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin')

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)

Been tryna hide it
Baby, what's it gonna hurt if they don't know?
Makin' everybody think that we solo
Just as long as you know you got me (you got me)
And boy I got ya
'Cause tonight I'm making deals with the devil
And I know it's gonna get me in trouble
Just as long as you know you got me

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give you up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)
I've been here all night
(Been here all night, baby)
I've been here all day
(Been here all day, baby)
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)

[Nicki Minaj:]
This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna Minaj I got a tricycle

All these bitches, flows is my mini-me
Body smoking, so they call me young Nicki chimney
Rappers in they feelings 'cause they feelin' me
Uh, I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me
Kissing me, copped the blue box that say Tiffany
Curry with the shot, just tell 'em to call me Stephanie
Gun pop and I make my gum pop
I'm the queen of rap, young Ariana run pop

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Say I should give him up
Can't hear them, no, 'cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)
I've been here all night
(Been here all night, baby)
I've been here all day
(Been here all day, baby)
Boy, got me walkin' side to side (side to side)

This the new style with the fresh type of flow
Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
Come true yo, get you this type of blow
If you wanna Minaj I got a tricycle</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm done with the drinking
I’m done with the smoking
I'm done with the playing
I'm done with the joking
I’m done with the ladies
I'm done with the fellas
Just sayin' (Yeah)
Farewell tequila, so long margarita
And Lady Sativa, I hate to leave ya
Don't want the pressure
I don't need a lecture
No, thank you, honey, God bless ya

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've said it all before (Said it all before)
But it won't hurt to do it all once more

[Chorus]
This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gonna stop ’tiI I go too far
Last hurrah and it’s okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

[Verse 2]
I’m done with the heartache
I'm done with the demons
Can't wait to be normal
Right after this weekend
I'm done with the drama
I’m fixing my karma
One more night of pure nirvana

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I've said it all before
But it won't hurt to do it all once more

[Chorus]
This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gonna stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll never change
But I'm still glad I came
Try again another day
But for now

[Chorus]
This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gonna stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Chorus]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't complicate it (Yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember (Yeah) all of the nights
I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah (Uh)</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
One day you will realize
The stars you are chasing shine bright deep inside you
But will you ever let it shine from within
And cast all of your fears aside?
You'll see the light, but until that day comes

My Dearly Beloved
Be strong, I shall be there
Always here beside you
So, keep your head held high
The shadows of this world
Will try to steal you away into their arms
But you belong in mine

We are one within a dream
So hold me close and count the stars with me
All our scattered memories
I will find the pieces, one by one

Ocean waves drift over me
I’ll keep you in my memory
This dream that lives within your eyes
I wish to see it come to life

A thousand blades unto the sky
Reach out and link our worlds, yours and mine
Let the tide rush over you
And one day I know we shall meet again
My Dearly Beloved</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
T-Series! (Yeah!)
It's your big day! (Woo!)
Incredible job!
I know we had our differences
But today, I just wanna tell you

[Chorus]
A congratulations, it's a celebration
Party all day, I know you've been waitin' (Here we go!)
A congratulations (Woo!), it's a celebration
I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing

[Verse 1]
A congratulations to your corporation
Guess to beat one Swedish boy, you need a billion Asians
Yeah, you did it very nice, and all it took
Was a massive corporate entity with every song in Bollywood
Now you're at number one (One), hope you did nothing wrong
Like starting your business by selling pirated songs
Oops! Didn't think we'd see? It's right there on Wikipedia
Get used to your past being held against you by the media (Uh oh)
I'm sure right now there's nothing that you're doing that's illegal, yeah
I'm certain that you haven't had collusions with the mafia
For legal reasons, that's a joke
For legal reasons, that's a joke
For serious, Indian mafia, please don't kill me, that's a joke
India, I'm sorry about the memes, you're the best
I love my Indian Bros, from Bombay to Bangladesh
I'll take on all the world for you, I'm a heavy hitter
'Bout to cause a genocide so you can call me Hi—

[Chorus]
A congratulations, it's a celebration (Oh!)
Party all day, I know you've been waitin' (Oh yeah!)
A congratulations (Woo!), it's a celebration (Yeah!)
I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing

Congratulations (Uh)
Congratulations (It's your big day! Woo!)
Congratulations
Congratulations (Such a big day)

[Verse 2]
I got a letter in the post, hmm, what is this? (Hmm)
T-Series saying "Cease and desist"
Had a problem with me telling them to hold their defecation
But let me educate you, silly, that's not defamation (Woo)
T-Series can eat a dick (Still not defamation)
Suck my fucking Swedish meatballs (Still not defamation, yum)
Did you know that Indians have poo-poo in their brains?
That's a blatant racist lie
Yeah, but still not defamation! (Woo)
India got YouTube figured out, that's sick, son
How 'bout next you figure how to fix the caste system? (Oof)
Maybe all those ads will solve your crippling poverty
But looking at T-Series' past, I'm guessing not probably
But never mind the poor people, we just here to party
Just here to pop some bottles with the 9-Year-Old Army
Non-alcoholic 'cause I had a real problem
But we still out here living like we 'bout to kamikaze

[Bridge]
So this is it, thanks for sticking with my channel
Ever since I was a nobody, screaming at barrels
Yeah, this is it, it's been an adventure
It's the end of the reign of Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg
Through all the change and controversy, you've been by my side
There's no army in the world, I would rather give me watch time
It's been a wild ride, so while I can still be heard
Here's one last brofist from the number one in the world

[Chorus]
A congratulations, it's a celebration (Oh)
Party all day (Skrra), I know you've been waitin' (Yeet, party all day, yeah)
A congratulations (Woo!), it's a celebration (Oh)
I just wanna tell you that I think that you're amazing

Congratulations (Oh, ooh hoo)
Congratulations (Skrattar du, it's your big day!)
Congratulations (I'm fucking lit!)
Congratulations (Such a big day!)
Oh yeah, yeah

Congratulations, T-Series! You did it!
Yatta desu ne
Hope that #MeToo stuff doesn't severely affect your bottom line</td>

🎤  Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Remember when we all got drunk?
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God, I felt so dumb, lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God, I felt so alone, lucky me

[Chorus]
(Ah) When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?

Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more

La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more

[Verse 2]
Remember when she broke my heart
Waitin' for the waiter to return my card?
Right as I let down my guard, lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we?

[Chorus]
(Ah) When all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Ah) What you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?

Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more

La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da

No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more

Screw your thing, it goes like this
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you

A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

[Verse 1]
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

[Chorus]
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

[Verse 2]
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

[Chorus]
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

Only one
Be your only one</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I’m taking?
All the smiles that I’m faking
“Everything is great
Everything is fucking great”
Going out every weekend
Staring at the stars on the ceiling
Hollywood friends, gotta see them
Such a good time
I believe it this time

[Chorus]
Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We’re dancing on tables
And I’m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn’t get better they say
We’re singing 'til last call
And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

[Verse 2]
Just like that and I’m sober
I’m asking myself, “Is it over?”
Maybe I was lying when I told you
“Everything is great
Everything is fucking great”
And all of these thoughts and the feelings
Cheers to that if you don’t need them
I’ve been checking my phone all evening
Such a good time
I believe it this time

[Chorus]
Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

We’re dancing on tables
And I’m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn’t get better they say
We’re singing 'til last call
And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

[Bridge]
Now I’m asking my friends how to say “I’m sorry”
They say “Lad, give it time, there’s no need to worry”
And we can’t even be on the phone now
And I can’t even be with you alone now
Oh, how shit changes
We were in love, now we’re strangers
When I feel it coming up, I just throw it all away
Get another two shots 'cause it doesn’t matter anyway

[Chorus]
We’re dancing on tables
And I’m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn’t get better they say
We’re singing 'til last call
And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
We’re dancing on tables
And I’m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn’t get better they say
We’re singing 'til last call
And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I’ll miss you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

[Verse 2]
Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

[Chorus]
My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad</td>

[Chorus]
You, you love it how I move you
You love it how I touch you, my one

A feelin' that you can't fight, my one
It lingers when we're done
You'll believe God is a woman

You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
Have it any way you like, yeah
And I can tell that you know I know how I want it

Baby, lay me down and let's pray

So baby, take my hands, save your soul
We can make it last, take it slow, hmm

And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
See if you deserve what comes next

🎤  Lyrics:
Je revois la ville en fête et en délire
Suffoquant sous le soleil et sous la joie
Et j'entends dans la musique les cris, les rires
Qui éclatent et rebondissent autour de moi
Et perdue parmi ces gens qui me bousculent
Étourdie, désemparée, je reste là
Quand soudain, je me retourne, il se recule
Et la foule vient me jeter entre ses bras

Emportés par la foule qui nous traîne
Nous entraîne
Écrasés l'un contre l'autre
Nous ne formons qu'un seul corps
Et le flot sans effort
Nous pousse, enchaînés l'un et l'autre
Et nous laisse tous deux
Épanouis, enivrés et heureux

Entraînés par la foule qui s'élance
Et qui danse
Une folle farandole
Nos deux mains restent soudées
Et parfois soulevés
Nos deux corps enlacés s'envolent
Et retombent tous deux
Épanouis, enivrés et heureux

Et la joie éclaboussée par son sourire
Me transperce et rejaillit au fond de moi
Mais soudain je pousse un cri parmi les rires
Quand la foule vient l'arracher d'entre mes bras

Emportés par la foule qui nous traîne
Nous entraîne
Nous éloigne l'un de l'autre
Je lutte et je me débats
Mais le son de ma voix
S'étouffe dans les rires des autres
Et je crie de douleur, de fureur et de rage
Et je pleure

Entraînée par la foule qui s'élance
Et qui danse
Une folle farandole
Je suis emportée au loin
Et je crispe mes poings, maudissant la foule qui me vole
L'homme qu'elle m'avait donné
Et que je n'ai jamais retrouvé</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When the lights go out, will you take me with you
And carry all this broken bone
Through six years down in crowded rooms
And highways I call home?

It's something I can't know 'til now
'Til you pick me off the ground
With a brick in hand, your lip-gloss smile
Your scraped-up knees

[Chorus]
And if you stay, I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long until we find our way
In the dark and out of harm?
You can run away with me anytime you want

[Verse 2]
Terrified of what I'd be
As a kid, from what I've seen
Every single day, when people try
And put the pieces back together
Just to smash them down
Turn my headphones up, real loud
I don't think I need them, now
'Cause you stop the noise

[Chorus]
And if you stay, I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long until we find our way
In the dark and out of harm?
You can run away with me anytime you want
Well, anytime you want
Well, anytime you want

[Bridge]
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away!</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

[Chorus]
Whoa, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

[Verse 2]
He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

[Chorus]
Whoa, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

[Bridge]
Mona Lisa, wear me out
I'm pleased to please ya
Mona Lisa, wear me out

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

[Chorus]
Whoa, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

There's nothing wrong with just a taste
Of what you paid for</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
Mr. Sandman bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I’ve ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I’m so alone
Don’t have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I’ve ever seen
Give him the word that I’m not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I’m so alone
Don’t have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Bung, bung, bung, bung

Mr. Sandman (Yes?)
Bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mr Sandman, someone to hold (Someone to hold)
Would be so peachy before we’re too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr Sandman, bring us, please, please, please
Mr Sandman, bring us a dream</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm a flame, you're a fire
I'm the dark in need of light
When we touch, you inspire
Feel it changing me tonight
Take me up, take me higher
There's a world not far from here
We can dance in desire
Or we can burn in love tonight

[Chorus]
Our hearts are like fire-stones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

Our hearts are like fire-stones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world
We light up the world

We light up the world
Whoa, oh
World
Whoa, oh
Firestone

[Verse 2]
I'm from X
You're from Y
Perfect strangers in the night
Here we are, come together
To the world we'll testify

[Chorus]
Our hearts are like fire-stones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

[Chorus]
Our hearts are like fire-stones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
And when they strike, we light up the world

We light up the world
We light up the word
Whoa, oh
World
Whoa, oh
Firestone</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can't I hold on?

[Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Verse 2]
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence, an echo lost in space

[Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood

And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Bridge]
I've watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find

[Chorus]
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does

And the freedom of falling
The feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, well

[Chorus]
But I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for me too

[Verse 2]
You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees and

[Chorus]
I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for me too

I'll be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
I'll be there for you
Like I've been there before
I'll be there for you
Cause you're there for me too
Cause you're there for me too</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse]
Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

[Chorus]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you’re looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

[Chorus]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

[Chorus]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The moment you arrived, they built you up
The sun was in your eyes, you couldn't believe it
Riches all around, you're walking
Stars are on the ground, you start to believe it

[Chorus]
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA

[Verse 2]
Nights at the chateau, trapped in your sunset bungalow
You couldn't escape it, yeah
Drink of paradise, they told you "Put your blood on ice"
You're not gonna make it

[Chorus]
Every face along the boulevard
Is a dreamer just like you
You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do

But nobody knows you now, when you're dying in LA
And nobody owes you now, when you're dying in LA
When you're dying in LA, when you're dying in LA
The power, the power, the power
Oh, the power, the power, the power
Of LA</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly
Now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel

Good enough
I feel good enough
For you

[Verse 2]
Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
I can't say no to you
Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely
Now I can't let go of this dream
Can't believe that I feel

[Verse 3]
It's been such a long time coming
But I feel good
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
Cause I can't hold on
To anything this good enough
Am I good enough
For you to love me to?

[Outro]
So take care what you ask of me
Cause I can't say no</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys, hey

[Verse 1]
When you’re talking to your girls
Do you talk about me?
Do you say that I’m a sweetheart?
Do you say that I’m a freak?
Do you tell them white lies?
Do you tell 'em the truth?
Do you tell 'em that you love me
The way I been lovin’ you?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell
For you

[Chorus]
'Cause I been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
It’s something bigger than myself
It’s something I don’t understand, no, no
I know we’re young and people change
And we may never feel the same
So, baby, tell me what you say

When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
I can hear ‘em talking
Oh, when the girls
When the girls
When the girls talk
When the girls talk boys, hey

[Verse 2: Calum, Luke, Ashton & (Michael)]
When you’re talking to your girls
Do you talk about me?
Do you tell I’m your lover?
That I’m all that you need?
Do you tell ‘em white lies?
Do you tell ‘em the truth?
(Do you tell 'em that you love me)
The way that I’ve been loving you?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell
For you

[Chorus]
'Cause I been talking to my friends
The way you take away my breath
It’s something bigger than myself
It’s something I don’t understand, no, no
I know we’re young and people change
And we may never feel the same
So, baby, tell me what you say

When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
I can hear ‘em talking
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
When the girls talk boys

Talk talk talk talk
Talk talk talk talk
When the girls talk boys
Talk talk talk talk (when the girls)
Talk talk talk talk, hey</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, in the box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits," yeah

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Bridge]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
Woah, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Woah, woah
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, woah

[Verse 1]
Oh, if you only knew
What we've been up to
I guarantee you'd keep it secret
So give it to me now
We're lost in a dream now
Do it (5-4-3-2) one more time

[Chorus]
In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning until the curtain's coming down

[Verse 2]
Ain't it so, ain't it so perfect
Our cynical minds will make it totally worth it
So give it to me now
We're lost in a dream now
Do it (5-4-3-2) one more time

[Chorus]
In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning until the curtain's coming down

[Bridge]
And we're all not here for nothing
And we're bored with looking good
We've got to be starting something
Would you change it if you could?
And we're all not here for nothing
And we're bored with looking good
We've got to be starting something
Would you change it if you could?

[Chorus]
In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning until the curtain's coming down

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend
The deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations
Sensation
We're winning until the curtain's coming down

We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
We're winning until the curtain's coming down</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me 'nother demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

[Pre-Chorus]
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don’t wanna hear about what to do
I don't wanna do it just to do it for you

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it’s like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I’m looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I've nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Chorus]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don’t wanna hear about what to do, no
I don't wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Bridge]
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

[Chorus]
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

[Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 2]
A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

[Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Bridge]
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Cold hands, white light
Yellow lamps on blackened skies
Duffel hoods and deep brown eyes
I'll sing you a song that I think you'll like

And we'll walk to places we always go
A million faces I don't know
I'll say the words you'd always hope
Set our hearts on racing even though

[Chorus]
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run, yea
I keep on falling
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run, yea
I keep on falling on you

[Verse 2]
On the way you stand, on the way you sway
The way your hair curls in the rain
The little lines that write your face
Or the winter nights you'd come and stay

Or the way you hit me when you wanna fight
The way I yearn, the way I cry
The way our love rolls with the tides
But we know we'll make up every time

[Chorus]
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run, yea
I keep on falling on you
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run, yea
I keep on falling on you

[Bridge]
Oh won't you bring me all the things I need
Like falling rain to a rolling sea
Oh won't you bring me all the things I need

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run
I keep on falling
I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run
I keep on falling

[Chorus]
And I know what you told me
I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Every time I run, yea
I keep on falling
And I know what you told me
Yea, I know that it's all over
And I know I can't keep calling
Just every time I run, yea
I keep on falling on you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1:]
You say love is messed up
You say that it don't work
But, you don't wanna try, no, no
(You don't wanna try, no, no)
And baby, I'm no stranger
To heartbreak and the pain of
Always being let go (Always being let go)

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I know there's no making this right, this right (This right)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Your mind)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

[Chorus:]
Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)

[Verse 2: RM]
So we don't gotta go there
Past lovers and warfare
It's just you and me now (Yeah, yeah)
I don't know your secrets
But I'll pick up the pieces
Pull you close to me now (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

[Chorus:]
Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not?

[Verse 3:]
Yay, don't you think there must be a reason?
Yeah, like we had our names
Don't you think we got another season
That come after spring?
I wanna be your summer
I wanna be your wave
Treat me like a comma
I'll take you to a new phrase
Yeah, come just eat me and throw me away
If I'm not your taste, babe, waste
Waste it on me

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)
And I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)
But we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh, yeah)
So if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time

[Chorus:]
Waste it on me, waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Baby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me
(Waste it on me)
Tell me, why not?</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions
Of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions...</td>

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one
One by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one
One by, one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over baby
I think you're pretty'
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one
One by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one
One by, one by one

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one
One by, one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one
One by, one by one</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere
So you know I care
But it's so cold
And I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower
Like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Pre-Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you
I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice
I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win
But I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song
That'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry
I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

[Pre-Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)

[Bridge]
I wanna sing a song
That'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry
I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
Think of all the animals you've ever heard about
like rhinoc'ruses and tigers cats and mink
There are lots of funny animals in all this world
But have you ever seen a panther that is pink?

Think!

A panther that is positively pink,

Well here he is, the pink panther,
The rinky-dink panther,
Isn't he a panther ever so pink?

He really is a groovy cat,
and what a gentleman, a scholar, what an acrobat !

He's in the pink - the pink panther
The rinky-dink panther,
and it's as plain as your nose,
that he's the one and only, truly original,
Panther-pink (panther) from head to toes !</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
The Sun, it changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

[Verse 2]
South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
And deep sea divin' 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

[Bridge]
We got two in the front
Two in the back
Sailin' along
And we don't look back
(Back, back, back-back-back-back...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone, a someone, a someone, a some</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kinda mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling, is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I-I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you..
Anymore</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1: V]
외로움이 가득히
피어있는 이 garden
가시투성이
이 모래성에 난 날 매었어

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
너의 이름은 뭔지
갈 곳이 있긴 한지
Oh could you tell me?
이 정원에 숨어든 널 봤어

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
And I know
너의 온긴 모두 다 진짜란 걸
푸른 꽃을 꺾는 손
잡고 싶지만

[Chorus: Jimin]
내 운명인 걸
Don't smile to me
Light on me
너에게 다가설 수 없으니까
내겐 불러줄 이름이 없어

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
You know that I can't
Show you me
Give you me
초라한 모습 보여줄 순 없어
또 가면을 쓰고 널 만나러 가
But I still want you

[Verse 3: Jin]
외로움의 정원에 핀
너를 닮은 꽃
주고 싶었지
바보 같은 가면을 벗고서

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
But I know
영원히 그럴 수는 없는 걸
숨어야만 하는 걸
추한 나니까

[Chorus: V]
난 두려운 걸
초라해
I’m so afraid
결국엔 너도 날 또 떠나버릴까
또 가면을 쓰고 널 만나러 가

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
할 수 있는 건
정원에
이 세상에
예쁜 너를 닮은 꽃을 피운 다음
니가 아는 나로 숨쉬는 것
But I still want you
I still want you

[Chorus: Jin]
어쩌면 그때
조금만
이만큼만
용길 내서 너의 앞에 섰더라면
지금 모든 건 달라졌을까

[Bridge: Jimin, Jungkook]
난 울고 있어
사라진
무너진
홀로 남겨진 이 모래성에서
부서진 가면을 바라보면서

[Outro: Jimin, Jungkook]
And I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you
But I still want you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Verse 2]
I've been walking through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
You left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair (No fair)
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've been feeling like it's impossible to say it all
And I'm losing all control
'Cause I wish that I could break the fall and save it all
I've been holding it too close

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I knew what you're thinking
Words don't come that easy
We might be broken by design
I can't help how I'm feeling
Scared of my own reasons
I don't wanna waste your time

[Chorus]
Searching for another way, another way, another way
To keep her safe another day, another day, another day
It's easier to run away, run away, run away
Than to know what to say, say, say
Than to know what to say

[Verse 2]
I just lie awake and play it out in my head
Like I know what to do
But the world has got a different plan for me and you
And it hurts when it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what you're thinking
Words don't come that easy
We might be broken by design
I can't help how I'm feeling
Scared of my own reasons
I don't wanna waste your time

[Chorus]
Searching for another way, another way, another way
To keep her safe another day, another day, another day
It's easier to run away, run away, run away
Than to know what to say, say, say

[Bridge]
(Say, say, say)
(Say, say, say)

[Chorus]
Searching for another way, another way, another way
To keep her safe another day, another day, another day
It's easier to run away, run away, run away
Than to know what to say, say, say
Than to know what to say, say, say
To know what to say, say, say</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
Frosty the snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around

Frosty the snowman
Was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said "Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away."

Down to the village
With a broom stick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can!"

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic stop
He only paused a moment when he heard them holler "Stop!"

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday."

Frosty the snowman
Was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Letra de "Amorfoda"]

[Estribillo]
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' eso' truco' ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé, yeh, yeh, yeh
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' eso' truco' ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé

[Verso]
Hoy te odio, no es secreto, ante todo lo confieso
Si pudiera te pidiera que devuelva' to' los besos que te di
La' palabra' y todo el tiempo que perdí
Me arrepiento una y mil veces de haber confiao' en ti (¡Wuh!)
Quisiera que te sienta' como yo me siento (Me siento)
Quisiera ser como tú, sin sentimiento' (-miento')
Quisiera sacarte de mi pensamiento (-miento)
Quisiera cambiarle el final al cuento
Toas' las barra' y los trago' han sido testigo
Del dolor que me causaste y to' lo que hiciste conmigo
Un infeliz en el amor que aún no te supera
Y que ahora camina solo sin nadie por toas' las acera'
Preguntándole a Dios si en verdad el amor existe
Y por qué si yo era tan bueno toa' esta mierda tú me hiciste (-ciste)
Lo más cabrón es que tú ve' todo como un chiste
Siempre voy a maldecir el día en que naciste
Los chocolate' que te di y todas las flores (-res)
Se convierten hoy en día en pesadilla' y dolore'
Ya yo perdí la fe de que tú mejore' (-jore')
Si después de la lluvia sale el arcoíri' pero sin colore', yeh

[Estribillo]
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' eso' truco' ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé, yeh, yeh, yeh
No quiero que más nadie me hable de amor
Ya me cansé, to' eso' truco' ya me los sé
Esos dolores los pasé, yeh, yeh, yeh</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

[Chorus]
Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

[Verse 2]
I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool

[Chorus]
Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

[Bridge]
Those thoughts of
Past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I
Could believe
You'd never wrong me
Then will you
Remember
Me in the same way
As I remember you

[Chorus]
Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories
In your house of memories
Promise me a place</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

[Verse 2]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

[Verse 4]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way

[Verse 5]
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way
Yes, it was my way</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I know you're scared, ooh, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me, you won't regret it, no
One more 'no' and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It's just a moment, go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I see your face

[Pre-Chorus 2: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
Ooh, and I don't need time to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!”, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore"

[Chorus]
I chime in with a
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...

[Verse 2]
Oh, well in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our marriage is saved
Well this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne
Oh! Well in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way
I mean technically our marriage is saved
Well this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne
Pour the champagne

[Chorus]
I chime in with a
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...
Poise and rationality
Again

[Chorus]
I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in
"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of...
Poise and rationality
Again</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
Robbie: “Are you, uh, a real villain?”
Bobbie: “Well, uh, technically... nah.”
Robbie: “Have you ever caught a good guy, like, uh, like a real superhero?”
Bobbie: “Nah.”
Robbie: “Have you ever tried a disguise?”
Bobbie: “Nah, nah...”
Robbie: “Alright! I can see that I will have to teach you how to be villains!”

[Hook]
Hey!
We are Number One
Hey!
We are Number One

[Verse 1]
Now listen closely
Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down in history
If you wanna be a Villain Number One
You have to chase a superhero on the run
Just follow my moves, and sneak around
Be careful not to make a sound
(Shh)
(No, don't touch that!)

[Hook]
We are Number One
Hey!
We are Number One
We are Number One

[Verse 2]
Ha ha ha
Now look at this net, that I just found
When I say go, be ready to throw
Go!
(Throw it on him, not me!)
(Ugh, let's try something else)
Now watch and learn, here's the deal
He'll slip and slide on this banana peel!
(Ha ha ha, gasp! what are you doing!?)

[Outro]
Ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Hey!
Ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Hey!
Ba-ba-biddly-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
We are Number One
Hey!
Hey!</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do

Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keepin' you clean
They gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

They said all
Teenagers scare
The living shit out of me
They could care less
As long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me

The boys and girls in the clique
The awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt
What you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

They said all
Teenagers scare
The living shit out of me
They could care less
As long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me

Oh yeah

They said all
Teenagers scare
The living shit out of me
They could care less
As long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me

All together now

Teenagers scare
The living shit out of me
They could care less
As long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me

Teenagers scare
The living shit out of me
They could care less
As long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss
In every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret
And each goodbye
Was a mistake to great to hide

And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes

Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

Across this new divide
Across this new divide</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

[Pre-Hook]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down

[Pre-Hook]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone (uh)

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pull up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Well, I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending, myself
But it started with an alright scene

It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, "You won't feel a thing"
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

[Verse 2]
I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show them what we all mean
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

[Bridge]
So go, go away, just go, run away
But where did you run to?
And where did you hide?
Go find another way, price you pay

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you, come on!

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you, at all

[Outro]
At all, at all, at all</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have

[Bridge]
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have</td>

Și te rog, iubirea mea, primește fericirea
Alo, alo, sunt eu Picasso
Ți-am dat beep, și sunt voinic
Dar sa știi, nu-ți cer nimic

Vrei să pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei
Nu mă, nu mă iei, nu mă, nu mă, nu mă iei
Chipul tău și dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tăi
Vrei sa pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei
Nu mă, nu mă iei, nu mă, nu mă, nu mă iei
Chipul tău și dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tăi

Te sun, să-ți spun, ce simt acum
Alo, iubirea mea, sunt eu, fericirea
Alo, alo, sunt iarăși eu, Picasso

Vrei sa pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei
Nu mă, nu mă iei, nu mă, nu mă, nu mă iei
Chipul tău și dragostea din tei

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Anytime I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
(Uh, switch it up)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like a alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yeugh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don't like the way he’s looking at you
I'm starting to think you want him too
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I’m getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why I still get jealous
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why I still get jealous

[Verse 2]
I wish you didn't have to post it all
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
Protective or possessive? Girl
Call it passive or aggressive?

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I’m getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It’s not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why I still get jealous
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why I still get jealous

[Bridge]
We're the only ones invited
Say there's no one else for you
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
When you get jealous too

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I’m getting red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus]
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why I still get jealous
'Cause you're too fucking beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why I still get jealous

[Outro]
Oh, that's why I still get jealous
Oh, that's why I still get jealous</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do, reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

[Bridge]
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe, I need to feel you here with me, yeah

[Chorus]
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should’ve fought it
At least I’m being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should’ve done you better
'Cause you don’t want a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Verse 2]
I don’t deserve it
I know I don’t deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I’ll make it worth it
Can’t you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Bridge]
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, hey
Please stay with me a minute
I swear I’ll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don’t want to be without you

[Chorus]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Outro]
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown (keep my head above water, above water)

[Bridge]
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe

[Refrain]
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

[Outro]
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (don't let me, don't let me drown)
Keep my head above water, above water</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
I'm a kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons, meaning
Maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

[Chorus]
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say they don't know you
And neither do I, so here's a prime example of a stand up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother, and his head's screwed up, but that's all right

[Bridge]
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

[Chorus]
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

[Chorus 1]
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

[Verse 2]
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

[Chorus 2]
Hello, I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

[Chorus 3]
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Somebody said you got a new friend
But does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around
And yeah I know it's stupid, but I just gotta see it for myself

[Chorus]
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh
I keep dancing on my own

[Verse 2]
I just wanna dance all night
And I’m all messed up, I’m so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I’m spinning around in circles

[Chorus]
And I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, nah

[Bridge]
So far away, but still so near
The lights come on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, nah
Said I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh​ no
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh no
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
And I keep dancing on my own

So far away, but still so near
The lights come on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

[Verse 2]
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

[Bridge]
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

Take me home, (down) country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you

[Pre-Chorus]
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
If you're tossin' and you're turnin'
And you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day I will remind you

[Pre-Chorus]
Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah

[Bridge]
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go
Never say goodbye

[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah

[Outro]
You can count on me cause I can count on you</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
Think I just remembered something
I think I left the faucet running
Now my words are filling up the tub
Darling, you're just soaking in it
But I know you'll get out the minute
You notice all your fingers pruning up

[Chorus]
I'm tired of being careful, tip toe, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

[Verse 2]
Think I got myself in trouble
So I fill the bath with bubbles
Then I'll put the towels all away
Should've never said the word "love"
Threw a toaster in the bathtub
I'm sick of all the games I have to play

[Chorus]
I'm tired of being careful, tip toe, trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap

[Chorus]
I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash, wash mouth, mouth with soap

I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You and I
We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky
With you, I'm alive
Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide

So stop time right here in the moonlight
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

[Choruss]
Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
I'm just a sad song

[Verse 2]
With you, I fall
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall
With you, I'm a beautiful mess
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge

So stop time right here in the moonlight
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

[Chorus]
Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song

[Verse 3]
You're the perfect melody
The only harmony
I wanna hear
You're my favorite part of me
With you standing next to me
I've got nothing to fear

[Chorus]
Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song

Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
I'm just a sad song</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Bridge]
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

[Chorus]
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

[Outro]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Your skin is warm like an oven, your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton when you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missing something whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients except you loving me
And respectfully

[Chorus]
I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

[Verse 2]
You smell just like vanilla, you taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses with empty calories
I feel like I’m just missing something whenever you leave
You've got all the ingredients except you needing me
So respectfully

[Chorus]
I’m not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I’m taking back what’s mine, you’ll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

[Bridge]
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (cake)
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (cake)
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me

[Chorus]
I’m not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I’m taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave
The slice of heaven that I gave to you
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (uh)

[Verse 1]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like...

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ayy)
I knew it when I met him (ayy), I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And then I had to tell him, I had to go
Oh na-na-na-na-na (woo)

Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (uh huh)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 2]
Jeffery, just graduated, fresh on campus, mmm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn (fresh out East Atlanta)
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (here you go, ayy)
Back it on me
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (on me)
She waited on me (then what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (wait up)
This is history in the makin', on me (on me)
Point blank, close range, that B
If it cost a million, that's me (that's me)
I was gettin' mula, baby

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (oh, ayy, ayy)
He took me back (uh huh) to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh, no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Bridge]
Ooh na-na, oh, na-na-na (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Take me back, back, back like...
Ooh na-na, oh, na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back like...
Ooh na-na, oh, na-na-na (yeah, yeah)
Take me back, back, back like...
Ooh na-na, oh, na-na-na (yeah, babe)
Take me back, back, back
Hey, hey...
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (hey)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (hey)
Take me back to my Havana...

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na (hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (oh, yeah)
He took me back to East Atlanta, (ayy, ayy) na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana (ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

Uh huh
Oh, na-na-na (oh, na, yeah)
Oh, na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na (no, no, no, take me back)
Oh, na-na-na
Havana, ooh na-na</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

[Chorus]
And don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]
And don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Don't they know that I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want 'cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Verse 2]
Together we can just let go
Pretend like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

[Bridge]
Come out tonight, come out tonight
There's no one standing in your way
Come out tonight, come out tonight
We don't care what them people say
We don't care what them people say

[Chorus]
We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party
I'm telling you to take your shot it might be scary
Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Life of the party
So don't let them keep you down
Oh you know you can't give up
'Cause we don’t have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I know you're not a liar and
I know you could set fire this day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down, I am calling your
Lightning down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me your face

[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down (Reign down)

[Verse 2]
I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by your ways
Why wouldn't you let us use your name?

[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me

[Outro]
Reign down (Down)
Reign down (Down)
(Down, down reign)</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

[Chorus 2]
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
Takes it all
The loser has to fall
Has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
It seems plain
Why should I complain?
Why complain

[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus 3]
The judges will decide
They decide
The likes of me abide
We abide
Spectators of the show
Of the show
Always staying low
Staying low
The game is on again
On again
A lover or a friend
Or a friend
A big thing or a small
Big or small
The winner takes it all
Takes it all

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
So the winner
Takes it all
And the loser
Has to fall
Throw a dice
Cold as ice
Way down here
Someone dear
Takes it all
Has to fall
It seems plain
Why complain</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Intro]
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 2]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do

[Verse 1]
Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it
My baby's favorite record
She been waiting for a minute
She invited all her friends
And I'm buying all the rounds
And they're all dolled up
DJ please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
When you gonna earn that pay
When you gonna play that song
And make my day

She said

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do
Hey

Play that song
The one the makes me stay out till dawn
The one that makes me go "ooh"
That's all you gotta do

[Verse 2]
Hey Mr. guitar
When you gonna strum it
My girl just heard this song
And you should play it cause she loves it
Can you get me off the hook
Get them fingers picking now
I'll throw some money in your cup
Mister please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
Why you gotta hesitate
When you gonna play that song
And make my day

She said

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do
Hey

Play that song
The one the makes me stay out till dawn
The one that makes me go oo
That's all you gotta do

[Bridge]
Oh
Wait till you see my baby moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove Moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove Wait till you see my baby moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove Moo-oo-oove
Moo-oo-oove

Oh come on now

[Chorus]
Play that song
The one that makes her go all night long
The one that makes her think of me
That's all you gotta do
Hey

Play that song
The one the makes her stay out till dawn
The one that makes her go oo
That's all you gotta do
Oo oo oo oo
Oo oo oo oo</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2]
So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 3]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

[Outro]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone?
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Verse 2]
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Bridge]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Outro]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

[Verse 2]
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Chorus]
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are crying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 2]
Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

[Chorus]
It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Now the night is coming to an end, ooh
The sun will rise and we will try again, ooh

[Chorus]
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die

[Verse 2]
I will fear the night again, ooh
I hope I'm not my only friend, ooh

[Chorus]
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die</td>

🎤  Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 5]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 6]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 7]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah</td>
